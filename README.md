# vue-strap
Bootstrap components built with Vue.js

This repository contains a set of native Vue.js components based on Bootstrap's markup and CSS. As a result no dependency on jQuery or Bootstrap's JavaScript is required. The only required dependencies are:

* Vue.js (required ^0.12, test with 0.12.10).
* Bootstrap CSS (required 3.x.x, test with 3.3.5). VueStrap doesn't depend on a very precise version of Bootstrap. Just pull the latest.

### Installation

## Docs
See the [documentation](http://yuche.github.io/vue-strap/) with live editable examples.

## Local Setup
* Install with `npm install`
* Run the docs site in development mode with `npm run docs`. This will watch for file changes as you work. 
* Build with `npm run build`.
